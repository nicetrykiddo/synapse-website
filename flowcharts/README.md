# Flowcharts Folder

Place your algorithm flowchart images here for the DAA (Design & Analysis of Algorithms) section.

## File Naming Convention

- `algorithm1.png` - First algorithm flowchart
- `algorithm2.png` - Second algorithm flowchart
- `algorithm3.png` - Third algorithm flowchart

Or update the names in `script.js` (lines 295-308) to match your file names.

## Supported Formats

- PNG (recommended)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG

## Recommended Image Size

- Width: 1920px or similar
- Height: 1080px or proportional
- Resolution: 72-150 DPI for web

## Tools to Create Flowcharts

1. **Draw.io** (https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - Free and web-based
   - Export as PNG with transparent background

2. **Lucidchart** (https://www.lucidchart.com/)
   - Professional flowchart tool
   - Free tier available

3. **Microsoft Visio**
   - Professional diagramming tool

4. **Figma** (https://www.figma.com/)
   - Modern design tool
   - Great for custom styled flowcharts

## Tips for Better Flowcharts

- Use high contrast colors (light shapes on dark background work well with the dark theme)
- Keep text readable (minimum 14pt font size)
- Use standard flowchart symbols:
  - Oval/Rounded Rectangle: Start/End
  - Rectangle: Process
  - Diamond: Decision
  - Parallelogram: Input/Output
- Add algorithm complexity notes (O(n), O(log n), etc.)
- Include step numbers for clarity

## Example Structure

```
